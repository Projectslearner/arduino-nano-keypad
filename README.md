# Keypad Module

#### Project Overview

The Keypad Module project demonstrates how to interface a 4x4 matrix keypad with an Arduino Nano. The keypad consists of 16 buttons arranged in a 4x4 grid. This project reads the button pressed on the keypad and prints the corresponding character to the serial monitor.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **4x4 Matrix Keypad**
3. **Jumper Wires**

### Block Diagram



#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Keypad to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the row pins of the keypad to the Arduino Nano pins as follows:
     - ROW0 to pin 9
     - ROW1 to pin 8
     - ROW2 to pin 7
     - ROW3 to pin 6
   - Connect the column pins of the keypad to the Arduino Nano pins as follows:
     - COL0 to pin 5
     - COL1 to pin 4
     - COL2 to pin 3
     - COL3 to pin 2

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the 4x4 matrix keypad to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer via USB.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - Press buttons on the keypad and observe the corresponding characters printed on the serial monitor.

#### Applications

- **Password Entry:** Use the keypad for secure password entry in access control systems.
- **Menu Navigation:** Implement the keypad for navigating menus in various projects.
- **User Input:** Capture user input in projects requiring numerical or alphanumeric entry.

#### Notes

- Ensure proper connections to avoid incorrect readings.
- The Keypad library simplifies the process of interfacing with the keypad, handling the reading of button presses and debouncing.
